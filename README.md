## Usage

1. Write your Blockscript code in the [`main.bs3`](main.bs3) file.
2. Compile the Blockscript code into Scratch code by running [`main.py`](main.py)
3. The compiled Scratch code will be saved as an `sb3` file.
4. Open Scratch and import the `sb3` file.

## Details

Blockscript files end in `.bs3`, but can be raw text as well. The Blockscript compiler will compile the project to a `.sb3` Scratch file.
